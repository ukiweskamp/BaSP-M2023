# Mega Rocket GYM

The project is about doing the web development of Mega Rocket GYM.
The development of the web system will facilitate the self-management of the partners to register for the classes and of the trainers to administer them.

## Usage

To get into the project index, you'll need to download the entire project from the github repository (index and assets).

## Week 1

During the first week we made the graphic layout with figma of all the necessary screens for web development.

## Week 2

Development of the HTML structure exclusively for the desktop version of the Landing Page.
Emphasis was placed on understanding and working on the semantics of the code and not on the graphic part.
