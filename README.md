# Mega Rocket GYM
The project is about doing the web development of Mega Rocket GYM.
The development of the web system will facilitate the self-management of the partners to register for the classes and of the trainers to administer them.

## Usage
To get into the project index, you'll need to download the entire project from the github repository (index and assets).

## Week 1
During the first week we made the graphic layout with figma of all the necessary screens for web development.
Landing Page, Socios, Profesores, Admin, Super Admin y Log In.

## Week 2
Development of the HTML structure exclusively for the desktop version of the Landing Page.
Emphasis was placed on understanding and working on the semantics of the code and not on the graphic part.
Images were added to the repository for the proper functioning of anyone who runs it by downloading it.

## Week-03
### **MegaRocket Landing Page Desktop**
Added a CSS style sheet to the HTML code to respond to BaSP-M2023 Weekly-Problematic-03.
